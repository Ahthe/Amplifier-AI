# Amplifier AI 🚀

Amplifier AI is an innovative platform designed to enhance lead generation and customer engagement through AI-powered tools. This project was part of the Headstarter Fellowship, and among 15,000 people or 3,000 teams, we won the final! 🎉 I am proud of my team.

## Why We Built It 💡

We wanted to push the boundaries of what AI can do and address a significant issue: 61% of startups fail due to poor marketing. 

- Amplifier AI was developed using: 
    - Next.js 
    - Python 
    - TypeScript 
    - AWS S3 
    - ClerkAuth 
    - Stripe 
    - OpenAI API 
    - Prisma 
    - PostgreSQL 


to tackle these challenges. Our platform features customizable AI Chatbots and an AI Lead Finder, potentially reducing the 38% failure rate due to ineffective strategies.

- Expanded reach to 56,000+ potential customers for a pilot driving school via AI chatbot support and targeted outreach on local Subreddits.
- Integrated payment processing with Stripe, implemented custom-made auth pages using Clerk, optimized data storage with AWS S3, and facilitated real-time communication via Pusher API.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
