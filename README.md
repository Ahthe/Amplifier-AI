# Amplifier AI 🚀

Amplifier AI is an innovative platform designed to enhance lead generation and customer engagement through AI-powered tools. This project was part of the Headstarter Fellowship, and among 15,000 people or 3,000 teams, we won the final! 🎉 I am proud of my team.

## Why We Built It 💡

We wanted to push the boundaries of what AI can do and address a significant issue: 61% of startups fail due to poor marketing to tackle these challenges. Our platform features customizable AI Chatbots and an AI Lead Finder, potentially reducing the 38% failure rate due to ineffective strategies.

    - Next.js 
    - Python 
    - TypeScript 
    - AWS S3 
    - ClerkAuth
