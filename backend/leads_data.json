But freelancing is no easier. Getting work on online freelancing platforms is tough with a new account.  Today, however, I'm starting my first freelance gig doing both product design and front end dev (my ideal role)  Funny enough, this opportunity came from a random conversation I had with a friend when I wasn't looking for anything  For anyone else struggling to find work in a crowded market, start with your personal network. Pre-established trust goes a long way.",
